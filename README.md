Week 1 

The Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard built using Power BI is designed to monitor and enhance supply chain efficiency while ensuring sustainability. It integrates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste reduction, and supplier compliance with environmental standards.
Through real-time data visualization, the dashboard empowers businesses to identify inefficiencies, track progress toward sustainability goals, and make informed decisions. It offers user-friendly, interactive charts and drill-down capabilities, providing actionable insights for optimizing operations. This balance of economic objectives and environmental responsibility fosters a greener, more efficient supply chain.
